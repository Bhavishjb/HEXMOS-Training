The goal for the assignment is to answer the
below questions using the "polldata.fps" data attached in the
assignment. You can open the attached file in any text editor such as
PyCharm.

Q1) Write a function load_fps(filepath) that reads the
attached file & then turns it into a structure of following sort
(list of dictionaries):
[
{
“Question”: “What’s the most liked shoe brand according to you?”,
“OptionVote”: {
“Option1”: Vote1,
“Option2”: Vote2,
…
“OptionN”: VoteN
},
“Tags”: [tag1, tag2, … tagN]
},
{
“Question”: “What’s the most liked shoe brand according to you?”,
“OptionVote”: {
“Option1”: Vote1,
“Option2”: Vote2,
…
“OptionN”: VoteN
},
“Tags”: [tag1, tag2, … tagN]
},
{
….
}
...
}
]

Q2) Suppose you’ve done the following:

polls_data = load_fps(filepath)

Now, write the function filter_by_tags(polls_data, list_of_tags)

Example:

Calling the following function (input):

filter_by_tags(polls_data, ["phone", "cricket"])

Should return as output:

List of dictionaries that have as tag either "phone" or "cricket"

This
function should return a filtered list of dictionaries (a subset of the
original polls_data that matches ANY of the given list of tags)


Q3) A view function for viewing the stats of a particular poll. It will take polls data from the file.

polls_data = load_fps(filepath)

view_poll(polls_data, pollNumber)

And output will be in this structure:

What’s the most liked shoe brand according to you?
* Puma 1
* Adidas 2
* Sparx 3
* Reebok 4

Tags: tag1, tag2, … tagN

Q4) A vote function which takes the pollNumber and OptionName and updates the poll_data dictionary

polls_data = load_fps(filepath)

polls_data = update_poll(polls_data, pollNumber, optionName)

If there is pollNumber which is given and if there is optionName which is given,
then update the optionName's vote by 1(increment 1).
Example: 
initial data - [{question: ..., optionVote: {puma: 5, ...}, tags: [...]}, ...]
after- update_poll(polls_data,1,”puma”)
output data- [{question: ..., optionVote: {puma: 6, ...}, tags: [...]}, ...]

Q5) A save function to save the state of polls_data back to the file format:

polls_data = load_fps(filepath)

...Operations...

save_poll(polls_data, filepath)

The polls_data should be written back to updated_polldata.fps file.
The fps file indicates the database.
